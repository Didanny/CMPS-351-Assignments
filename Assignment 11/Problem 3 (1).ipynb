We have 2 functions that we need to minimize that in essense are based on if one wants to more accuratly estimate the function values $\\|Qu-d\\|$ or if one wants the interval between the partitons which represent $c$ to be precisie as they were taken by measurments which represent $\\|c-c^0\\|$ where $c^0$ represents the supposed intervals at which it was taken. Finally, $A(c)u= w$ is an equality constraint in which you want the curvuture of the function to be accurately retrived.\n",
